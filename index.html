          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.

        <p class="testimonial-card__quote">
          “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and heard great things. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks were the best—and most grueling—time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers and now work as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

        <p class="testimonial-card__quote">
          “Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
          I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
          The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
          In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. 
          It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!”
